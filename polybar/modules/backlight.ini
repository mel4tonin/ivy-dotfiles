; Use the following command to list available cards:
; $ ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/
; Default: first usable card in /sys/class/backlight (new in version 3.7.0)
card = amdgpu_bl1

; Use the `/sys/class/backlight/.../actual-brightness` file
; rather than the regular `brightness` file.
; New in version 3.6.0
; Changed in version: 3.7.0: Defaults to true also on amdgpu backlights
; Default: true
use-actual-brightness = true

; Interval in seconds after which after which the current brightness is read
; (even if no update is detected).
; Use this as a fallback if brightness updates are not registering in polybar
; (which happens if the use-actual-brightness is false).
; There is no guarantee on the precisio of this timing.
; Set to 0 to turn off
; New in version 3.7.0
; Default: 0 (5 if use-actual-brightness is false)
poll-interval = 0

; Enable changing the backlight with the scroll wheel
; NOTE: This may require additional configuration on some systems. Polybar will
; write to `/sys/class/backlight/${self.card}/brightness` which requires polybar
; to have write access to that file.
; DO NOT RUN POLYBAR AS ROOT. 
; The recommended way is to add the user to the
; `video` group and give that group write-privileges for the `brightness` file.
; See the ArchWiki for more information:
; https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight#ACPI
; Default: false

; Interval for changing the brightness (in percentage points).
; New in version 3.7.0
